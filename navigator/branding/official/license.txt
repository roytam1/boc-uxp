1. LICENSE GRANT.
Binary Outcast grants you a non-exclusive license to use the executable code version of the Product.

(a) Binary Outcast grants you permission to distribute executable code versions of the Product providing they are UNALTERED or otherwise identical to those provided by Binary Outcast itself.
(b) In the case of open source operating systems building executable code versions from source, express permission must be obtained from Binary Outcast before any such executable code version containing intellectual property may be distributed through any medium.
